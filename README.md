A web-based application built using **Flask** for performing **sentiment analysis**, **named entity recognition (NER)**, and **text summarization**. This project includes user authentication with a **login** and **registration** system, and a personalized **profile page** where users can select various NLP tasks.


- **User Authentication**: Register, log in, and access personalized profiles.
- **NLP Actions**:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify entities such as names, locations, and dates in text.
  - **Summarization**: Generate a concise summary of input text.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Real-time display of NLP analysis results on the profile page.

## Usage

### User Authentication:
1. Register for an account or log in with existing credentials.
2. After logging in, access the **Profile Page** where you can choose between:
   - **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - **Summarization**
   
3. Enter the text and submit the form to see the respective NLP result.

### NLP Actions:
